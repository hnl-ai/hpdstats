<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project provides a dashboard interface that tracks and updates from the [HPD's published daily arrest log reports](https://www.honolulupd.org/information/arrest-logs/).

### Why this exists:
The Attorney General's Office provdes [annual reports](https://ag.hawaii.gov/cpja/rs/cih/) as to the state of crime in Hawaii. This project provides a mechanism to validate these reports, track the numbers daily, and keep an archive of the raw data.
